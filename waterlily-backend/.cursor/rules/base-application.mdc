## **Project Context**
The application you'll build is a simplified version of our **user intake form system**. An essential element of the Waterlily product is collecting the **demographic, health, and financial information** used in our machine learning model to predict a person’s long-term care needs and costs.


## **Survey App Requirements**

### **Frontend (Survey Interface)**

A survey form with:

- Question title
- Question description
- Input fields for user responses
- Submit button to complete the survey
- Post-submission review: Allow users to view their submitted responses

### **Backend**
Implement any necessary backend functionality to support the survey interface (e.g., API endpoints, database storage)


## **Potential Improvements**

If you have extra time, consider enhancing this application with the features you think might be the most impactful and explain why. The following list are a few suggestions, you are free to implement these or your own improvements.  **Please** **provide a rationale for your choice(s)**.

- User Authentication (e.g., sign-in, session management)
- Enhanced Survey UX:
- Single-question display format
- Navigation between questions (Next/Previous)
- Progress indicator
- Form Validation (e.g., required fields, input constraints)
- Responsive Design & UI Improvements
When choosing additional features explain why you focused on them over others. We’re interested in your ability to make trade-offs and justify decisions given the time constraints.
